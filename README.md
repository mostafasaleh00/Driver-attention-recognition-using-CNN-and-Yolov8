 This project presents a deep learning based system for classifying driver states into 
six categories: safe driving, unsafe driving, distracted, drinking, sleeping, and yawning. Using a dataset of 12,000 
training images and 2,000 testing images, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was initially developed, 
achieving an accuracy of 91%. To further enhance performance, the YOLOv8 object detection framework was 
employed, boosting the overall classification accuracy to 96%
